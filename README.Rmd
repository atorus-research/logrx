The goal of timber is to facilitate logging in a clinical environment with the goal of making code easily traceable and reproducible.

## Installation

This package is still in development and currently is only available from GitHub. To install the development version run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("atorus-research/timber")
```

## What is ```timber``` ?

Simple!  The timber package makes a log file for a R script!.  Below we have a short gif of
making a log file for a `adsl.R` script.  More details on the parts of the log script
are found in the [Get Started](https://atorus-research.github.io/timber/articles/timber.html) and
we have several vignettes that show specific use cases for using the package.


```{r img-with-knitr, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='Caption for this figure 1'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/timber.gif")
```


While many packages to facilitate the logging of code already exist in the R ecosystem, it is hard to find a solution that works well for clinical programming applications.  Many logging implementations are more implicit and rely on user input to create the log for the execution of a script.  While this is useful for logging specific events of an application, in clinical programming a log has a set purpose.  

```timber``` is built around the concept of creating a log for the execution of an R script that provides an overview of what happened as well as the environment that it happened in.  We set out to create a flexible logging utility that could provide the necessary information to anyone reviewing the code execution so they can recreate the execution environment and run the code for themselves.  ```timber``` is purpose-built for the needs of clinical programming to capture necessary elements of the environment and execution to be able to create a complete view of the program execution.

## Using timber
```timber``` can be used in a file or through scripting.  More information on how to use ```timber``` can be found in [Get Started](https://atorus-research.github.io/timber/articles/timber.html).

## Future development
While this development version has been released, the development team is still making improvements to the package.  This release is intended to give access to the core functionality of ```timber``` while it is still being developed.  While the main functions and functionality have already been created, there are still many behind the scenes items that need to be addressed.
